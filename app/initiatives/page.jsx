            Advocacy
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white text-xl my-4 font-semibold">
            Zimbabwean children and youth have been actively engaged in the
            development of Countryâ€™s NDCs, NAPs, and LEDs while also being
            actively involved in the revision processes of environmental
            legislation such as the Forestry Act and the Environmental
            Management Act. Having played a huge part in formulating the above
            strategies, plans, policy briefs and legislation, youths throughout
            the country have a sense of ownership and responsibility to ensure
            their implementation and accountability. And, this has been evident
            in the gradual increase of youth participants at COPs since COP21.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white text-xl my-4 font-semibold">
            However, there is still a long way until we achieve our climate
            ambitions and goals as a country, continent and globe. Young people
            particularly from rural and non-urban communities are still
            vulnerable to the effects of climate change in their day-to-day
            lives as water sources keep drying up, and loss of biodiversity
            especially deforestation has caused an ecosystem shift which has
            negative impacts on their homes, soil, agriculture and other forms
            of livelihoods. While children and youth in Zimbabwe have shown an
            improved understanding of climate change, there is a need to enhance
            their capacity to advocate for reductions in emissions, better
            access to climate finance, and ensure that our leaders are adhering
            to the Paris Agreement by actively participating in the Global
            Stocktake process.

          <p className="text-white text-xl my-4 font-semibold">
            Climate education is a cornerstone of AYICC Zimbabwe's mission to
            empower young people with the knowledge and skills needed to address
            climate change. Through workshops, school programs, and community
            outreach, we aim to raise awareness about the causes and impacts of
            climate change. Our initiatives focus on promoting sustainable
            practices, such as climate-smart agriculture, renewable energy
            adoption, and waste management. By educating the next generation, we
            are fostering a culture of environmental stewardship and equipping
            youth to become advocates for a sustainable future.

            clean-up campaigns, recycling initiatives, and educational programs,
            we aim to reduce waste and its harmful impact on the environment.
            Our efforts include engaging youth and local communities in proper
            waste segregation, composting, and advocating for policies that
            support a circular economy. By addressing waste management
            challenges, we are contributing to a cleaner, healthier, and more
